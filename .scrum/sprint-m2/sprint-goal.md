Sprint 1 - Milestone 2

Timeframe Wednesday February 4th - Wednesday Februrary 11th

The goal of this sprint is to complete all the requirements outlined in Milestone 2. These include: design use case diagrams, explain architecture overview and component identification, design diagrams (data-flow diagram, class diagram, sequence diagram) and update the traceability matrix. The goal of this sprint is to have a good understanding of the project as a whole, so the team as a whole can understand exactly what we will be expected to do before actually getting into the coding and development of the app.
