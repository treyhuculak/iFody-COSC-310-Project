Respect Guidelines:
We prioritize productive, respectful communication. Shouting and profanity are considered disrespectful and will not be tolerated. Our group is committed to maintaining harmony through proactive collaboration; however, if a conflict escalates beyond our control, we will consult the instructor for mediation.

Accountability for Disrespect:
If a disagreement between members becomes unproductive, a neutral group member will act as a mediator to facilitate an amicable solution internally.
If mediation is unsuccessful, the entire team will discuss the issue. We will listen to all perspectives and work toward a consensus that addresses the root cause of the friction.
If disrespect persists despite our internal efforts, we will report the behavior to the Instructor or TA. At this stage, the matter is no longer a group discussion and will be handled as an individual accountability issue between the teaching staff and the parties involved.

Decision-making Process: 
We should strive to come to a cohesive decision with all group members compromising to get everyone on board.
If we are unable to reach a compromise on an idea or decision, then it would go to majority rules, but we should try and avoid this, as a united decision is stronger and will likely exist if we try hard enough to get there


Anticipated conflicts:
Disagreements regarding the high-level approach or technical strategy to achieve the best project outcome.
Confusion or disagreement over the specific roles and functional titles each member holds.
Disputes over how specific tasks and workload items are distributed among the team.
Challenges regarding meeting times, individual availability, and internal submission deadlines.
Divergent ideas on the project’s final design and the decision-making process for selecting the best path forward.


Conflict management:
As a general rule, all normal conflict that exists in a team environment should be handled within the group and not be taken to the TA and/or Professor.
If conflict is being had between only two group members, the neutral parties should try to stay neutral and be mediators to hash out the conflict (a sense of calm)
In extreme cases where there is personal conflict that has taken over the team and sorting it out within the team is futile, then it can be taken to the TA, who can then take it to the Professor if need be.

Individual commitments: 
Trey: I commit to putting my full effort into whatever task I am working on. I commit to being active in the team communication and to contribute ideas for both the project and with bugs etc. I commit to holding myself accountable for the work I put out and the work that I check. I commit to finishing my tasks before the deadline and to ensure that my work does not hold up other peoples work when it is in my control. Finally I commit to having fun and learning as much as I can as I feel this experience is very important for my success in my career.
Aaron: My commitment to the team is to first make sure I complete the work assigned to me to the best of my ability. I will clearly communicate on a fixed cycle, what I have accomplished to ensure my role and progress are understandable and transparent to my teammates, helping prevent information failure. I will also do my best to remain objective when facing problems or conflicts. If I have spare time after completing my own tasks, I will try to take on part of others' work if they experience schedule conflicts.
Joao: I commit to timely, complete submissions and maintaining productive communication. As a newcomer to Software Engineering, I will prioritize learning and applying new concepts to our project. I plan to be fully engaged in all meetings, supporting the team through both development and organizational efforts.
Umberto: I commit to delivering my assigned tasks on time and ensuring the quality of all my contributions. I will also do my best to help any teammate who is struggling with their part and to communicate any progress made by me consistently. Finally, I plan to be fully participative in all group meetings and apply what I learn throughout the duration of this course.
Joshua: I commit to complete my assigned tasks before the deadline, remain active in team communication, be respectful and responsible. I will do my best to help my teammate in order to build a nice project. I will engage actively in all meetings and be supportive along the project development.
